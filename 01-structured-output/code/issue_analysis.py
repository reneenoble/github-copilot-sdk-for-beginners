Title: Database connection pool exhaustion under load

Our PostgreSQL connection pool runs out of connections during peak hours.
The app uses SQLAlchemy with a pool size of 10. Under load testing with
100 concurrent users, we see "QueuePool limit exceeded" errors after
about 2 minutes. Need to implement connection pooling with PgBouncer
or increase pool size with proper timeout handling.
