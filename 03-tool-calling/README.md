- ✅ Define custom tools using `@define_tool` and Pydantic models
- ✅ Understand the tool invocation lifecycle
- ✅ Give the agent the ability to read repository files

## Pre-requisites

- Completed [Chapter 2 — Prompt Engineering](../02-prompt-engineering/README.md)
- `pydantic` installed

## Introduction

So far, your Issue Reviewer can analyze issue text that you paste into the prompt. But in the real world, issues often reference files:

> "The bug is in `src/auth/login.py` — the `validate_credentials()` function doesn't handle expired tokens."

Wouldn't it be great if the agent could **read that file itself** and include the code in its analysis?

That's what **tools** enable. A tool is a function that the model can choose to call when it needs additional information or capabilities. You define the tool, and the model decides when and how to use it.

## Key Concepts

### What Are Tools?

A **tool** is a function you expose to the model. Each tool has:

1. **A name** — how the model refers to it (e.g., `get_file_contents`)
2. **A description** — helps the model decide when to use it
3. **Parameters** — what arguments the tool accepts (defined as a schema)
4. **A handler** — the actual Python function that runs

![Diagram showing the tool lifecycle: Model sees tools → Decides to call → SDK runs handler → Result returned to model](./images/tool-lifecycle.png)

<!-- TODO: Add diagram to ./03-tool-calling/images/tool-lifecycle.png — A circular flow diagram: (1) "Model sees available tools" → (2) "Model decides to call a tool" → (3) "SDK runs your handler function" → (4) "Result returned to model" → (5) "Model incorporates result into response" → back to (2) if more tools needed, or → (6) "Final response". -->

### The Tool Schema

Tools are defined using Pydantic models (for type-safe schemas) and the `@define_tool` decorator:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from copilot import define_tool

class GetFileParams(BaseModel):
    file_path: str = Field(description="Path to the file in the repository")

@define_tool(description="Read the contents of a file from the repository")
async def get_file_contents(params: GetFileParams) -> str:
    with open(params.file_path, "r") as f:
        return f.read()
```

### How the Model Chooses Tools

When you provide tools, the model can:
1. **Call a tool** if it needs information to answer the prompt
2. **Call multiple tools** in sequence for multi-step reasoning
3. **Skip tools entirely** if it can answer without them

You don't tell the model *when* to use tools — the model decides based on the prompt and available tools.

> 💡 **Tip:** Write clear, specific tool descriptions. The model uses the description to decide when a tool is appropriate.

## Demo / Code Walkthrough

### Defining a File Reader Tool

Let's create a tool that reads files from a local repository:

```python
import asyncio
import json
import os
from copilot import CopilotClient, define_tool
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class GetFileParams(BaseModel):
    file_path: str = Field(description="Relative path to the file in the repository")


# Define the tool — the model can call this when it needs file contents
@define_tool(description="Read the contents of a file from the repository")
async def get_file_contents(params: GetFileParams) -> str:
    """Read a file from the local repository."""
    repo_root = os.environ.get("REPO_PATH", ".")
    full_path = os.path.join(repo_root, params.file_path)

    # Safety: prevent path traversal
    full_path = os.path.realpath(full_path)
    if not full_path.startswith(os.path.realpath(repo_root)):
        return "Error: Access denied — path is outside the repository"

    try:
        with open(full_path, "r") as f:
            return f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return f"Error: File not found: {params.file_path}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error reading file: {e}"
```

### Using the Tool in a Session

Now let's pass the tool to a session and let the model use it:

```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a GitHub issue analyzer with access to repository files.

When an issue references specific files, use the get_file_contents tool to read
those files and include code context in your analysis.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object:
{
  "summary": "<one sentence>",
  "difficulty_score": 1-5,
  "recommended_level": "Junior | Mid | Senior | Senior+",
  "files_analyzed": ["<list of files you read>"]
}
"""

ISSUE_WITH_FILE_REFS = """
Title: Fix authentication bypass in login handler

The login handler in src/auth/login.py has a vulnerability where
expired JWT tokens are still accepted. The validate_token() function
in src/auth/tokens.py doesn't check the 'exp' claim properly.
"""


async def main():
    client = CopilotClient()
    await client.start()

    session = await client.create_session({
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "system_message": {"mode": "replace", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},
        "tools": [get_file_contents],  # Pass your tool to the session
    })

    # The model will detect file references and call get_file_contents
    response = await session.send_and_wait({
        "prompt": f"Analyze this issue:\n\n{ISSUE_WITH_FILE_REFS}"
    })

    print(response.data.content)

    await session.destroy()
    await client.stop()


asyncio.run(main())
```

### Watching Tool Calls in Action

To see when the model calls your tool, add event listeners:

```python
def on_event(event):
    if event.type.value == "tool.execution_start":
        print(f"🔧 Tool called: {event.data.tool_name}")
        print(f"   Arguments: {event.data.arguments}")
    elif event.type.value == "tool.execution_complete":
        print(f"✅ Tool complete: {event.data.tool_name}")

session.on(on_event)
```

![GIF showing the terminal: model analyzes issue, calls get_file_contents for two files, then returns the analysis](./images/tool-calling-demo.gif)

<!-- TODO: Add GIF to ./03-tool-calling/images/tool-calling-demo.gif — An animated terminal recording showing: (1) User runs the script, (2) "🔧 Tool called: get_file_contents" appears with file path argument, (3) "✅ Tool complete" appears, (4) Model calls a second file, (5) Final JSON analysis is printed.

## 🧠 Knowledge Check

1. Who decides when to call a tool — you or the model?
   - A) You explicitly call tools in your code
   - B) The model decides based on the prompt and tool descriptions ✅
   - C) Tools are called randomly

2. What does the `@define_tool` decorator do?
   - A) It registers a function as a tool the model can call ✅
   - B) It locks a function so only the model can use it
   - C) It converts a function to async

3. Why should you validate file paths in your tool handler?
   - A) To make the code run faster
   - B) To prevent the model from accessing files outside the repository (security) ✅
   - C) To reduce token usage

---

## 📖 Extra Reading: Parallel Tool Calls

The model can sometimes call multiple tools in parallel for efficiency. For example, if an issue references three files, the model might request all three file reads simultaneously.

Things to consider:
- **Ordering** — if one tool depends on another's output, the model handles sequencing
- **Determinism** — parallel calls may return in different orders
- **Optional challenge:** Add a second tool, like `get_commit_history(file_path)`, and see how the model uses both together
