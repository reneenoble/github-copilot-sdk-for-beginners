# Contributing to GitHub Copilot SDK for Beginners

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug, typo, or something that doesn't work as expected:

1. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/microsoft/github-copilot-sdk-for-beginners/issues) to avoid duplicates.
2. Open a new issue using the appropriate template:
   - **Bug Report** — something in a lesson doesn't work
   - **Content Suggestion** — you'd like to see a lesson on a new topic
   - **Translation** — you'd like to translate a lesson

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create a branch** for your change: `git checkout -b fix/chapter-03-typo`
3. **Make your changes** following the style guide below.
4. **Test** any code changes by running the demos.
5. **Submit a PR** with a clear description of what you changed and why.

### Contributing Translations

We'd love to have this course available in more languages!

1. Open an issue using the **Translation** template to coordinate.
2. Create your translation under `translations/<language-code>/`.
3. Translate prose only — leave code, file names, and variable names in English.
4. Maintain the same folder structure as the English original.
