## 🧩 Real-World Analogy: The Open Kitchen

Imagine two restaurants. At the first, you order and then stare at a blank wall for 20 minutes until a plate appears. At the second, there's an **open kitchen** — you can see the chef selecting ingredients, firing the grill, plating the dish. The food takes the same time, but the experience is completely different.

| Closed Kitchen (send_and_wait) | Open Kitchen (Streaming) |
|---|---|
| You wait in silence | You see each step as it happens |
| You wonder if something went wrong | You know exactly what's being prepared |
| You get the final dish all at once | You see ingredients, cooking, plating — then the dish |

Streaming turns your agent from a closed kitchen into an open one. The model is doing the same work either way — reasoning, calling tools, building a response — but with streaming, your user can watch each step unfold in real time.

The **agent loop** is the chef's process: read the order (prompt), decide what's needed (reasoning), grab an ingredient (tool call), check the result, decide if more is needed, and finally plate the dish (final response). Streaming lets you narrate that entire process to the user.

## Introduction

In the previous chapter, you added tools to your agent. When you called `send_and_wait`, the SDK silently ran the entire reasoning loop — thinking, calling tools, processing results — and only gave you the final answer. That works, but from the user's perspective the app freezes while thinking.

In production, users want to see **progress**. They want to know the agent is working, what it's doing, and how it's progressing. That's where **streaming** comes in.

This chapter covers two important concepts:

1. **The Agent Loop** — how the SDK orchestrates multi-step reasoning
2. **Streaming** — how to show real-time updates as the agent works

---

## Key Concepts

### The Agent Reasoning Loop

When you call `send_and_wait`, the SDK doesn't just make a single API call. It runs a **loop**:

![Agent loop diagram — a flowchart showing the multi-step reasoning cycle](./images/agent-loop-diagram.png)

<!-- TODO: Add diagram to ./04-agent-loop-streaming/images/agent-loop-diagram.png — A flowchart (800×600) showing: (1) "User sends prompt" → (2) "Model thinks" → Decision diamond: "Need a tool?" → YES → (3) "Call tool" → (4) "Get result" → back to (2). NO → (5) "Generate response" → (6) "Return to user". Add a counter label showing "Iteration 1, 2, 3..." on the loop back arrow. Include a red "Max iterations" guard on the loop. -->

Here's what happens in each iteration:

1. **The model receives** the conversation so far (system prompt + messages + tool results)
2. **The model decides** whether to call a tool or generate a response
3. **If it calls a tool**, the SDK runs your handler and feeds the result back
4. **If it generates a response**, the loop ends and the result is returned

This loop can run multiple iterations. For example, your Issue Reviewer might:

- **Iteration 1**: Read the issue, decide to fetch `src/auth/login.py`
- **Iteration 2**: Read the file contents, decide to also fetch `src/auth/tokens.py`
- **Iteration 3**: Analyze both files and generate the final review

### Preventing Infinite Loops

What if the model keeps calling tools forever? The SDK includes a default iteration limit, but you should also be aware of it in your design:

```python
# The agent will stop after a reasonable number of iterations
# If you need to adjust behavior, design your prompts carefully
session = await client.create_session({
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "system_message": {
        "mode": "replace",
        "content": """Analyze the issue and respond with your assessment.
        
IMPORTANT: Read at most 3 files. If an issue references more than 3 files,
analyze the first 3 and note the others in your response."""
    },
    "tools": [get_file_contents]
})
```

> 💡 **Tip**: Limiting tool usage in the system prompt is a practical way to keep the agent focused and prevent excessive iteration.

### Streaming Responses

Instead of waiting for the complete response, you can **stream** it — receiving text as the model generates it, word by word. Enable streaming in your session configuration:

```python
session = await client.create_session({
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "system_message": {
        "mode": "replace",
        "content": "You are a GitHub issue reviewer."
    },
    "tools": [get_file_contents],
    "streaming": True  # ← Enable streaming
})
```

### Listening for Streaming Events

With streaming enabled, you can hook into events as they happen:

```python
# Stream text as it arrives
def on_delta(event):
    print(event.data.delta_content, end="", flush=True)

session.on("assistant.message_delta", on_delta)

# Know when the final message is complete
def on_complete(event):
    print("\n\n--- Response complete ---")

session.on("assistant.message", on_complete)
```

### Tool Activity Events

You can also listen for tool-related events to show progress:

```python
def on_tool_start(event):
    print(f"\n🔧 Calling tool: {event.data.tool_name}...")

def on_tool_complete(event):
    print(f"✅ Tool complete: {event.data.tool_name}")

session.on("tool.execution_start", on_tool_start)
session.on("tool.execution_complete", on_tool_complete)
```

Combining these events, you can build an experience like:

```
🔧 Calling tool: get_file_contents...
✅ Tool complete: get_file_contents
🔧 Calling tool: get_file_contents...
✅ Tool complete: get_file_contents

Based on my analysis of the issue and the referenced files...
The authentication bypass in login.py occurs because...
```

## Demo Walkthrough

Let's build a streaming agent that shows real-time progress. Create a file called `streaming_agent.py`:

```python
import asyncio
from copilot import CopilotClient, define_tool
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
import os


class GetFileParams(BaseModel):
    file_path: str = Field(description="Relative path to the file")


@define_tool(description="Read the contents of a file from the repository")
async def get_file_contents(params: GetFileParams) -> str:
    repo_root = os.environ.get("REPO_PATH", ".")
    full_path = os.path.realpath(os.path.join(repo_root, params.file_path))
    if not full_path.startswith(os.path.realpath(repo_root)):
        return "Error: Access denied"
    try:
        with open(full_path, "r") as f:
            content = f.read()
            return content[:10_000] if len(content) > 10_000 else content
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return f"Error: File not found: {params.file_path}"


async def main():
    client = CopilotClient()
    await client.start()

    session = await client.create_session({
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "system_message": {
            "mode": "replace",
            "content": """You are a GitHub issue reviewer. Analyze the issue,
fetch any referenced files, and provide a detailed assessment.

Respond in plain text with clear sections:
- Summary
- Files analyzed
- Assessment"""
        },
        "tools": [get_file_contents],
        "streaming": True
    })

    # --- Register event listeners ---
    def on_delta(event):
        """Print each chunk of text as it arrives."""
        print(event.data.delta_content, end="", flush=True)

    def on_message(event):
        """Called when the full message is assembled."""
        print("\n\n✅ Response complete.")

    def on_tool_start(event):
        """Show which tool is being called."""
        print(f"\n🔧 Calling: {event.data.tool_name}...")

    def on_tool_complete(event):
        """Confirm tool execution finished."""
        print(f"✅ Done: {event.data.tool_name}\n")

    session.on("assistant.message_delta", on_delta)
    session.on("assistant.message", on_message)
    session.on("tool.execution_start", on_tool_start)
    session.on("tool.execution_complete", on_tool_complete)

    # --- Send the issue ---
    issue = """
    Title: Fix token expiry validation

    The validate_token() function in src/auth/tokens.py doesn't check the
    'exp' claim. Expired tokens are accepted by the login handler in
    src/auth/login.py. This is a security vulnerability.
    """

    print("📋 Sending issue for review...\n")
    response = await session.send_and_wait({"prompt": issue})

    await client.stop()


asyncio.run(main())
```

### Running the Demo

```bash
python streaming_agent.py
```

You should see output appearing progressively:

![Animated GIF showing streaming terminal output with tool calls and progressive text](./images/streaming-demo.gif)

<!-- TODO: Add animated GIF to ./04-agent-loop-streaming/images/streaming-demo.gif — Record a terminal session (80×24, ~15 seconds) running streaming_agent.py. Show: (1) "📋 Sending issue for review..." appears, (2) "🔧 Calling: get_file_contents..." appears, (3) "✅ Done: get_file_contents" appears, (4) A second tool call, (5) Response text streams in word by word, (6) "✅ Response complete." appears. Use a dark terminal theme. -->

### What's Happening Under the Hood

When you run this:

1. `send_and_wait` starts the agent loop
2. The model reads the issue and decides to call `get_file_contents` for `src/auth/tokens.py`
3. The `tool.execution_start` event fires — you see "🔧 Calling..."
4. Your tool handler runs and returns the file content
5. The `tool.execution_complete` event fires — you see "✅ Done"
6. The model may call another tool (loop continues)
7. When the model generates its response, `assistant.message_delta` fires for each chunk
8. When complete, `assistant.message` fires once

---

## Session Idle — Knowing When Everything Is Done

The `session.idle` event fires when the session has fully finished processing — all tool calls are done, all messages streamed, and no more work is pending:

```python
def on_idle(event):
    print("\n🏁 Session is idle — all processing complete.")

session.on("session.idle", on_idle)
```

This is useful when you need to perform cleanup or trigger downstream actions after the agent finishes.

---

## Building a Status Reporter

Here's a practical pattern — a status reporter that tracks the agent's progress through labeled phases:

```python
import time

class StatusReporter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        self.tools_called = 0

    def elapsed(self):
        return f"{time.time() - self.start_time:.1f}s"

    def on_tool_start(self, event):
        self.tools_called += 1
        print(f"  [{self.elapsed()}] 🔧 Tool #{self.tools_called}: "
              f"{event.data.tool_name}")

    def on_tool_complete(self, event):
        print(f"  [{self.elapsed()}] ✅ Complete")

    def on_delta(self, event):
        print(event.data.delta_content, end="", flush=True)

    def on_complete(self, event):
        print(f"\n\n📊 Finished in {self.elapsed()} "
              f"with {self.tools_called} tool call(s)")

    def register(self, session):
        session.on("tool.execution_start", self.on_tool_start)
        session.on("tool.execution_complete", self.on_tool_complete)
        session.on("assistant.message_delta", self.on_delta)
        session.on("assistant.message", self.on_complete)
```

Usage:

```python
status = StatusReporter()
status.register(session)
```
